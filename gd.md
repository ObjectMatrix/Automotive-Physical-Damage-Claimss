# Gradient Descent: A fundamental algorithm in Machine Learning  

Gradient descent is a mathematical optimization technique used in machine learning and many other computational fields. To understand it, it's essential to know what a function's gradient is.
In multi-dimensional space, a function can have multiple inputs, and the rate at which it changes concerning each input can be different. The gradient of a function is a vector that consists of all its partial derivatives. Each partial derivative represents how much the function's output changes as one particular input changes, while all other inputs are held constant.
Think of the gradient as an arrow pointing in the direction of the steepest incline on the function's landscape. If you were hiking and wanted to ascend as quickly as possible, you'd follow the gradient. However, in optimization, we want to find the lowest point, so we consider the negative of the gradient - this points us in the direction of the steepest descent.
Gradient descent uses this information to move step-by-step toward the function's lowest point. By iteratively taking small steps opposite the gradient's direction (the steepest ascent), we move toward the function's minimum value. The size of these steps is controlled by the learning rate.
Gradient descent navigates the multi-dimensional landscape of a function by following the gradient vector, composed of its partial derivatives, to find the function's minimum value efficiently.




## Given the quadratic equation $`[ x^2 + x = y ]`$ 
$`[ x^2 + x = y ]`$

We can rewrite it in the standard quadratic form as:
$`[ x^2 + x - y = 0 ]`$

Applying the quadratic formula $`( x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a} )`$, where $`( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = -y ),`$ we get:

$`[ x = \frac{{-1 \pm \sqrt{{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-y)}}}}{2 \cdot 1} ]`$

$`[ x = \frac{{-1 \pm \sqrt{{1 + 4y}}}}{2} ]`$

Thus, the solutions are:

$`[ x = \frac{{-1 + \sqrt{{1 + 4y}}}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{{-1 - \sqrt{{1 + 4y}}}}{2} ]`$


## To solve the equation $`[ x^3 + x = y ]`$
$`[ x^3 + x = y ]`$
This equation does not lend itself to simple algebraic manipulation for a direct solution due to its cubic nature.

To solve the equation $x^3 + x = y$ for $x$ in terms of $y$, follow these steps:

1. **Recognize the Equation Type**: Notice that this is a cubic equation in $x$.

2. **Rearrange the Equation**: We start with the given equation and aim to isolate $x$. The original equation is

   $$x^3 + x = y$$

3. **Use Cardano's Formula**: For cubic equations of the form $x^3 + px + q = 0$, we can use Cardano's method. However, our equation needs to be in the form of $x^3 + px = -q$ to directly apply the method. Comparing this to our equation, we have $p = 1$ and $q = -y$.

4. **Apply the Transformation**: To solve $x^3 + x + (-y) = 0$, we apply the cubic formula which might involve complex numbers and is generally represented as:

   $$x = \sqrt[3]{\frac{-q}{2} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^3}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{-q}{2} - \sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^3}}$$

   Plugging $p = 1$ and $q = -y$ into the formula gives us a solution in terms of $y$. Due to the complexity of the cubic roots and potential for complex numbers, the exact form of the solution can be quite intricate.

5. **Solving Numerically or Using a CAS**: For specific values of $y$, one would typically use a numerical method or a computer algebra system (CAS) to find the roots of the cubic equation. 

This approach gives a conceptual framework for solving the equation $x^3 + x = y$ for $x$ in terms of $y$. Due to the complexity of the solution for cubic equations, numerical or CAS-based solutions are often employed for specific instances.

 ## To solve the equation $`[ x^4 + x = y ]`$ 
$`[ x^4 + x = y ]`$ we recognize it as a quartic (fourth-degree) polynomial equation. Solving quartic equations analytically involves complex formulas, but let's outline the conceptual steps for understanding this process

To address the equation $x^4 + x = y$ for $x$ in terms of $y$, we proceed with the following conceptual framework:

1. **Identify the Equation Type**: This is a quartic equation, indicating it's of the fourth degree in terms of $x$.

2. **Equation Rearrangement**: Begin with the provided equation, aiming to isolate $x$. The equation given is

   $$x^4 + x = y$$

3. **Transformation for Solution**: Quartic equations can theoretically be solved using Ferrari's solution, which involves reducing the quartic equation to a cubic one, then solving the cubic equation to eventually solve for $x$. However, our equation directly does not fit the standard form without modification.

4. **Applying Quartic Solution Techniques**: For a quartic equation of the form $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, specific methods like Ferrari's method can be applied. In our case, we simplify to

   $$x^4 + x - y = 0$$

   This simplification sets $a = 0$, $b = 0$, $c = 1$, and $d = -y$.

5. **Numerical or CAS-based Solutions**: Given the complexity of the solutions to quartic equations, which involve nested radicals and potentially complex numbers, exact solutions in terms of radicals might not be straightforward or practical to express for all cases. For specific $y$ values, numerical methods or a computer algebra system (CAS) are typically used to find the roots.

Due to the intricacy of solving quartic equations analytically, especially for general forms like $x^4 + x = y$, employing a CAS for particular instances or numerical approximation techniques becomes a practical necessity. This ensures a solution can be obtained even when an explicit formula in terms of radicals is too complex to be practically useful.

Given the quartic equation:

$$x^4 + x = y$$

The solution for $x$ in terms of $y$ is given by:

$$x = \frac{1}{2} \left( -\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{y} + \sqrt{y - 2 \left( \sqrt[3]{y} - \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{y}}} \right)}} + \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{y} - \sqrt{y - 2 \left( \sqrt[3]{y} - \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{y}}} \right)}} \right)$$

where

$$\gamma = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{(4y)^3}{27}}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{(4y)^3}{27}}}$$

Note that this solution is derived using advanced algebraic methods and may not cover all possible solutions to the quartic equation.



## Solving the equation $`[ x^5 + x = y ]`$  
for x in terms of y is much more complex than solving quadratic equations because there is no general formula for polynomials of degree five or higher, due to the Abel-Ruffini theorem, <a href="https://[readme.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem)/" target="_blank">Abel-Ruffini </a> . This means that, in general, we can't express the solutions in terms of radicals as we can for quadratics, cubics, and quartics.

However, we can still find solutions numerically or graphically. Numerical methods such as Newton's method can be used to approximate the roots of this equation for specific values of 
y. If you're interested in a symbolic approach, you would typically use a computer algebra system to manipulate the equation and find solutions.

The equation $`[ x^5 + x = y ]`$ may have multiple real roots and complex roots, but without numerical values or further context, we cannot proceed with finding a closed-form solution.
If we're looking for an analytical approach for specific values of y, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solutions. Would you like to see how numerical methods can be used to approximate a solution for a given value of y?

In Machine Learning (ML), we often deal with problems that don't have neat, closed-form solutions. The functions we're trying to optimize can be highly complex and not easily solvable with algebraic formulas. Instead, we use iterative algorithms, like gradient descent, that gradually improve the solution by taking steps toward lower error rates based on the data.  ML algorithms provide a practical approach to finding solutions in a landscape too complex for algebraic solutions, making them powerful tools for a wide range of applications.


The process of finding a cubic polynomial that approximates the function cos(x)  as closely as possible over the interval 
[0, π]. This is typically done using methods from numerical analysis, such as polynomial regression or, more commonly for function approximation, the method of least squares.

The polynomial we're seeking has the form   where a, b, c, d are the coefficients that we need to determine. These coefficients will be chosen so that the polynomial closely matches the behavior of the cosine function on the interval from 0 to π.

One common way to determine these coefficients is by using the method of least squares, which involves minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences (errors) between the polynomial's values and the true values of cos(x) at a set of points within the interval. This can be achieved by solving a system of linear equations that comes from setting the partial derivatives of the sum of squared errors with respect to each coefficient to zero.

The result will be a polynomial that doesn't exactly match cos(x)at every point, but will be the best approximation in terms of the least squared error across the interval. The cubic polynomial can then be used as a simpler approximation for calculations that would otherwise require the more complex cosine function.
